# 📬 AI Task Intake Automation (Zapier • No-Code)

A lightweight workflow that automatically converts actionable emails into structured task data using **Zapier’s free tier**.  
This project demonstrates clear automation logic, operational workflow design, and the fundamentals needed for AI-enabled process automation.

---

## ⭐ Overview

Many teams receive tasks by email, but inboxes are unstructured and hard to track.  
This automation solves that by:

1. Watching Gmail for emails containing task-related keywords  
2. Extracting relevant information  
3. Logging each task into a structured Google Sheet  

This creates visibility, reduces cognitive load, and forms a foundation for more advanced AI-driven workflow automation.

## 🧠 Problem

Task requests arrive in email with no structure, no categorization, and no tracking.  
Operations teams waste time manually logging tasks or, worse, lose visibility entirely.

---

## 🎯 Goal

Create an automation that:

- Identifies actionable emails  
- Extracts structured data  
- Logs the information to a central source of truth  
- Works entirely on **free-tier tools**  
- Demonstrates clean automation design for portfolio purposes
